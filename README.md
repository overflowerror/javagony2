Javagony With A Twist

## What is Javagony

[Javagony]{https://esolangs.org/wiki/Javagony} is an esoteric programming language. It's basically Java without any conditional (`if`, `else`, `switch`), loop (`for`, `while`, `do while`) keywords or conditional expressions (`?:`).

## What is Javagony2

(I have no idea if someone else already did this. Nevertheless: Let me coin the term right now.)

Javagony2 is an "extension" of Javagony. In addition to all the features Javagony is missing, in Javagony2 there is also no `try-catch` and no `import`.

## Why?

It's actually kinda fun. Give it a try sometime.
